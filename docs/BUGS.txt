-- Known Bugs --

Must be fixed before release:
- "Insert new changelog entry" button not enabling

Low priority:
- Detailed progress dialog does not always size correctly on construction
- Menu/Launcher page: Text in 'Other' text area is highlighted in gray when imported
  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
  - Only occurs when using 'WriteText' method in wx 2.8
