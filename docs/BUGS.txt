-- Known Bugs --

Must be fixed before release:
- Removed devices to not get removed directory tree on refresh

High priority:

Low priority:
- Detailed progress dialog does not always size correctly on construction
- Menu/Launcher page: Text in 'Other' text area is highlighted in gray when imported
  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
  - Only occurs when using 'WriteText' method in wx 2.8
- Progress dialogs can resize outside of display boundaries
- wx 2.8:
  - Taskbar icon does not show up
- wx 3.0 only:
  - Credits list does not expand completely on right edge
- Some binary executables are recognized as 'application/x-sharedlib' MIME type from 'file' command
  - Find a workaround to display these as binary executables in directory tree
- 'None' is written to first line of log file output
