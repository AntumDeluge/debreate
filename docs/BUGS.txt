-- Known Bugs --

Must be fixed before release:
- Progress dialogs are not refreshing on Files page
- App crashes is trying to delete item & parent directory together in directory tree

  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
  - Only occurs when using 'WriteText' method in wx 2.8
- Progress dialogs can resize outside of display boundaries
- wx 2.8:
  - Taskbar icon does not show up
  - 'Changes' text control is small on Changelog page
- wx 3.0 only:
  - Credits list does not expand completely on right edge
