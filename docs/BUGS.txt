Must be fixed before release:
- 'Others' field not being completely filled out in menu/launcher page when project/launcher imported
- Progress dialogs are not refreshing on Files page
- Multi-selecting files/folders does not import all of them
- DirectoryTree class cannot be refreshed/recreated
  - Options:
    - Add refresh method
    - Remove 'Refresh' option from Files page

Low priority:

  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
  - Only occurs when using 'WriteText' method in wx 2.8
- 2.8 Only
  - Taskbar icon does not show up
  - 'Changes' text control is small on Changelog page
- 3.0 Only
  - Credits list does not expand completely on right edge
