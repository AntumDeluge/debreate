-- Known Bugs --

Must be fixed before release:
- Files page: Progress dialog not showing for wx 2.8
- Staged build directory isn't deleted

Low priority:
- Menu/Launcher page: Text in 'Other' text area is highlighted in gray when imported
  - Always occurs with wx 3.0
  - Only occurs when using 'WriteText' method in wx 2.8
